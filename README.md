# rpi-dns-updater

A little script to update Cloudflare DNS with the latest IP address on my RaspberryPi.
My RaspberryPi also hosts my WordPress website to this script plays an important part in keeping my website reachable despite having a dynamic IP address.
With this script I can literally plugin my RaspberryPi to any network and run my site.
