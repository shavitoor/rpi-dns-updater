# rpi-dns-updater

A little script to update Cloudflare DNS with the latest IP address on my RaspberryPi.

My RaspberryPi also hosts my WordPress website so this script plays an important part in keeping my website reachable despite having a dynamic IP address.

With this script I can literally plugin my RaspberryPi to any network and run my site. (**bummer!** - need to figure out how to do it on NATs? Dunno yet? Make a tunnel? But then it would fefeat the porpose of hosting a website on RPi :\ )
